# JSentenceHighlighter

WIP - not currently recommended for use.

Anki addon for use with a Japanese vocab+sentence deck. It searches for the vocab word in the sentence, and marks it in the sentence according to the user's preference.

Yomichan can now mark the target word in the sentence when adding the card, and that is preferable because no guessing is required. But this addon could be useful for Yomichan users who want to fill in the sentence highlighting on old cards created before the feature was available.

The file deinflect.json is taken from the Yomichan project ( https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/ ) and was originally based on data from Rikaichan ( http://www.polarcloud.com/rikaichan ).
